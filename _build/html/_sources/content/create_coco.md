# Create your COCO format dataset

In order to use the deep learning models that power Annolid, your dataset needs to be in a format that is compatible with it (in this case the COCO format).
Click on the 'COCO dataset' buttom. Click and select the annotation directory, the label file and the number of frames to use for training.

```{note}
If you choose a number of frame for training that is more than the number of available frame, the software will automatically split the dataset to use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing.
```

To help guide you through the process we made the following video:
