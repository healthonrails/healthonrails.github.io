# Annolid ModelZoo

We are collecting here exemple datasets and pretrained models that you can use out-of-the-box to make your analyses.
We are always looking for more datasets to expand annolid use-case. We would love to hear from you if you have one! [Get in touch](get_in_touch).

## Exemple Dataset

An example dataset annotated with Annolid and converted in the COCO format is available to this Google Drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUXCLnoJ5SwXg54mj0NBKGzidsV8ALVR/view?usp=sharing.

Example image of this dataset:

## Pretrained models

The pretrained models associated with the previous datasets are shared to the following Google Drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t1eXxoSN2irKRBJ8I7i3LHkjdGev7whF?usp=sharing

## Annolid ModelZoo

We are in the process of setting up Annolid ModelZoo. Besides this example dataset we are looking forward to provide you with pretrained models for a bunch of behavioral paradigm so you just have to do video analysis (ie inference) without the need to train the model yourself.
