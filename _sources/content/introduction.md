# Introduction with examples
Annolid stands for:  Annotation + Annelid (segmentation).

Annolid is based on instance segmentation models. Instance segmentation is the task of attributing every pixel of an image to a specific category. It can be used to detect and delineate each distinct object of interest appearing in that image. As such it facilitates the tracking of multiple animals and along with it the flexible state identification (e.g., behavior classification, urine deposition, interactions among objects). Annolid has self-supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised training options. We are striving to incorporate optical flow mechanics to improve performances as well as improving labeling efficiency via autolabeling and iterative model training.

Currently, Annolid is a work-in-progress, still in its alpha version, and subject to major changes. Nevertheless we hope you can use this jupyterbook as an efficient support to guide you through the process of using Annolid for your specific use case.

If you need help or encounter an issue don't hesitate to reach out to the developers by openning an [issue](get_in_touch) on Github.

## Annolid can be applied to many diverse goals


- Animal Tracking
- Keypoints tracking (i.e. body parts)
- Automated behavior recognition
